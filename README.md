Relationship to `itertools`
---------------------------

The `itertools` package (with an `s`) is a package in the standard library.  It differs from `itertoolz` (with a `z`) in the following ways.

*   `itertools` has an `s`.  `itertoolz` has a `z`.
*   `itertools` is strictly a library of [*streaming algorithms*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm) while `itertoolz` accepts functions that require finite iterators.
*   `itertools` changes very slowly and is managed by the official Python community (you submit a `PEP`).  `itertoolz` is more loose (you submit a pull request)
*   `itertools` is minimal.  `itertoolz` accepts recipes.
